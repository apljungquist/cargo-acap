# `cargo-acap-build`

This folder contains a Docker image suitable for Rust development with the [AXIS Camera Application
Platform](https://www.axis.com/en-us/products/analytics/acap). The image contains a custom Rust build and associated
C/C++ cross-compilers supporting `--target=`:

* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `armv5te-unknown-linux-gnueabi`
* `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi`
* `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi`
* `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`
* `mipsisa32r2el-axis-linux-gnu`

## Tags

This image is built from tagged releases of the Rust compiler, e.g. `trunnion/cargo-acap-build:1.46.0`.

## Details

### Project layout

The `docker build` context is located in `docker/`. It contains a `Dockerfile`, a `config.toml` for the Rust build, and
a script which adds the `mipsisa32r2el-axis-linux-gnu` target. Building this image requires a considerable amount of
resources; see [the `rustc-dev` docs](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/prerequisites.html#hardware) for
more specific guidance.

`.github/workflows/` contains GitHub Actions definitions to build these images automatically.

### Custom MIPS target

Axis ARTPEC-4 and ARTPEC-5 chips contain MIPS32r2 cores in a little-endian configuration. `/proc/cpuinfo`:

```

This processor corresponds to Rust targets `mipsel-*`, except that none of them quite fit:

* `mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu` use the incompatible `fpxx` floating point ABI
* `mipsel-unknown-linux-musl` use the compatible soft-float ABI but use `musl` as libc, which cannot be statically
   linked on MIPS due to interference with `libbacktrace-sys`
* `mipsel-unknown-linux-uclibc` is again compatible but again requires an alternate libc `.so`

`mipsisa32r2el-axis-linux-gnu` is a custom target specifically for `cargo-acap`, configured as
`mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu` except with `+mips32r2,+soft-float` like `mipsel-unknown-linux-musl` and
`mipsel-unknown-linux-uclibc`. Additionally, this target is built with the Axis-provided GNU toolchain, since there is
no commonly-distributed C toolchain with exactly the right configuration.
